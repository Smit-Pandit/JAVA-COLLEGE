// Q1.)Design a class called figure . It must have three attributes r,aand v of the data type douoble.It must have the
// following methods:
// public void dispArea(); public void dispVolume();
// The method dispArea must have a statement to print the volume of a. The method dispVolume();
// must have a statement to print the value of v.Design a class cone . It must extends class figure class .It must also
// have the following attributes h,s of type double.It must have following methods:
// public void calcArea();public void calcVolume();
// The formulae for the area and volume of the cone are as follows:
// Area of a cone(p*r*s)+(p*r*s)
// volume of a con=(p*r*s)/3
// Write a main method in a class called inheritance demo to demonstrate inheritance.
